Search:
- add "clear search" button/action that clears search and removes all filters
  on comments (tip: remove "search:" text before the search bar and you will
  have space for another button)

- developer panel - should be just "finish" button that takes to the home
  startScreen

- home screen - three groups of configs:
    - interface
    - content
    - clutter
  and a "start experiment" button

- paragraph level - do not show comments/bubbles if there aren't any. In case of
  heatmap we don't display "empty" heatmap, do we? empty paragraph indicators
  only distract

- selecting text completely messes up markup and we can't really prevent users
  from doing that. Solution: disable watchers in "SelectionService". Those were
  added for "creating" comments, which we don't need anymore

- randomize names of comment posters

- connect LoggerService's "log" call to all the interactive parts with
  corresponding messages:
    - start experiment (log participantId, timestamp, and all the config params)
    - click on an anchor (log comment ID)
    - click on a comment (log comment ID)
    - search (log search term)
    - clear search (log what was in search before clearing)
    - click on heatmap (log number of comments on heatmap and line number)
    - click on paragraph indicator (log number of comments in the paragraph and
      paragraph number)
    - end experiment (log participantId, timestamp, and all the config params)

- remove all console.log statements
