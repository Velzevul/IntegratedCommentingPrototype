                    <p id="paragraph4" paragraph="" class="ng-scope">In June last year a small American company called Eukarion sought permission to carry out the first trials of an <note-90266 id="145" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">anti-ageing drug</note-90266>, SCS, <note-98849 id="10" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="2">on human beings</note-98849>.

                    <p id="paragraph5" paragraph="" class="ng-scope">Some scientists, however, are <note-10457 id="148" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">quick to discourage extravagant speculation.</note-10457> 'There is <note-17194 id="149" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">no evidence</note-17194> whatsoever that swallowing any chemical would have an <note-20194 id="150" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">effect on mammals</note-20194>', says Rich Miller of the University of Michigan. 'And those people who claim it might need to go out and<note-16260 id="151" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1"> do some experimenting</note-16260>'. Some research, moreover, has produced alarming results. As well as controlling ageing, these, <note-11867 id="152" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">genes also partly control the hormones which regulate growth</note-11867>. The upshot of this is that although the lives of mutant mice can be extended by up to <note-3825 id="153" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">80 per cent, they remain smaller than normal</note-3825>.</p>

Even if the <note-3195 id="154" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">falling birth-rates reported in the world's developed nation</note-3195>s were to be repeated throughout the world, would this be sufficient to compensate for massively extended life-expectancy, and would we be willing to see the demographic balance of our society change out of all recognition? David Gems, the head of the Centre for Research into Ageing at University College, London, is enthusiastic about the <note-58696 id="155" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">opportunities opened up by extended life</note-58696>, but even he observes, 'If people live much longer, the proportion of <note-88057 id="156" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">children would. of course, he very small</note-88057>. It strikes me that it might feel rather claustrophobic: all those middle-aged people and very few children or young people.'</p>

                    <p id="paragraph7" paragraph="" class="ng-scope">The philosopher John Polkinghorne emphasises that any discussion of the merits of life-extending therapies must take into account the <note-31790 id="157" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="2">quality of the life that is lived:</note-31790> 'One would not wish to prolong life beyond the <note-98233 id="159" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">point it had ceased to be creative</note-98233> and fulfilling and meaningful,' he says. 'Presumably, there would have to come a point at which life ceased to be creative and<note-55180 id="25" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1"> became just repetition.</note-55180> Clearly, there are only so many rounds of golf one would want to play.'</p>

                    <p id="paragraph8" paragraph="" class="ng-scope">But Polkinghorne, a member of the Human Genetics Commission, also observes that so far our experience of extended life-expectancy <note-88917 id="160" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">has not resulted in world-weariness</note-88917>. Throughout the last century, life-expectancy rose consistently, thanks to improved diet, <note-23732 id="161" comment-anchor="" class="document__anchor document__anchor--teal ng-isolate-scope document__anchor--num" comment-active="false" data-content="1">better hygiene</note-23732>, continuous medical innovation and the provision of free or subsidised healthcare.

'Consider also, the lives of our Roman and Anglo-Saxon ancestors' he says.
